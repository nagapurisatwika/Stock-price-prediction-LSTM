PROJECT REPORT  
===============

Title: Stock Price Trend Prediction Using LSTM  
Student: Nagapuri Satwika  
Tools & Technologies: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, yfinance, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
Model: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network

----------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE
---------
The objective of this project is to predict future stock prices using historical price trends. We use a deep learning model (LSTM) that is suitable for sequential time-series data, like stock prices.

----------------------------------------
DATASET
-------
- Source: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance API)
- Stock: Apple Inc. (Ticker: AAPL)
- Period: From January 1, 2015 to January 1, 2024
- Feature Used: Closing price only
- No external CSV or manual data is needed. Data is downloaded live using code.

----------------------------------------
METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Data Collection:
   - Downloaded historical closing price data for Apple Inc. from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Normalized the prices to values between 0 and 1 using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Created time sequences of 60 days to use as input to predict the 61st day price.

3. Model Building:
   - Designed an LSTM model with two LSTM layers followed by a Dense output layer.
   - Used Mean Squared Error as the loss function and Adam optimizer.

4. Model Training:
   - Trained the model for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 using the entire dataset (simplified version).

5. Prediction & Evaluation:
   - Made predictions on the dataset and plotted both actual and predicted prices for visual comparison.
   - Used inverse transformation to convert predicted values back to actual price scale.

----------------------------------------
RESULTS
-------
- The model successfully captured the trend of the stock price movement.
- Although trained on the same data (no test split), it showed a strong ability to follow the actual pattern.
- The graph displayed predicted prices closely matching actual prices.

----------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
----------
- LSTM is effective for time-series prediction such as stock prices.
- The model can predict stock trends using only the 'Close' price.
- Real-time data access through yfinance makes the project dynamic and updated.

----------------------------------------
FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
- Add more features like Open, High, Low, Volume.
- Integrate technical indicators like RSI, Moving Average.
- Use a separate testing dataset for better evaluation.
- Build a web app using Streamlit for user interaction and visualization.
- Explore other deep learning models like GRU or BiLSTM.
